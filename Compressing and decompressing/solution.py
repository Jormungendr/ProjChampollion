    Iterate over and decompress the compressed string.
    This approach makes use of nested Python iterators, which is a very clean way
    of expressing expansion of nested iterated items.
    Args:
        text: The entire string to decompress.  It's unobvious, but nice
          to have the whole string plus an index; this allows any error
          detection code to report the absolute index of a problematic
          character.
        start: The starting index within 'text'.  We decompress from
          'start' up through the matching close-brace or end-of-string.
        times: The number of times to repeat decompression.

    # O(n) additional time, and a temporary requirement for O(n + 3) additional
    # space during the copy operation.
    #
    # This is O(decompressed-length) for speed (probably), and up to
    # O(compressed-length/4) for additional storage.  In this implementation,
    # the storage requirement is well-disguised: It appears on the function call
    # stack, rather than in declared variables.  E.g., consider a worst-case
    # input of: 1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[1[xx]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
    # which would require a stack depth of 20.
    #
    # The (probably) for the big-O depends on how well Python implements
    # resumption of nested iteration.  At worst, the string above would require
    # a full stack descent, then ascent for *each* of the two 'x' characters,
    # for a total of O(n^2) time.  Another very well-hidden possible cost.
